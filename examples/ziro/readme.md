# Ziro

Ziro is Termelot project to showcase how the library can be used to develop larger software. Ziro *will be* a text editor similar to GNU Nano. Pull requests welcome!

For now, we are unable to focus on developing Ziro and other examples, because we are fixing bugs in the library and making the backends feature-complete.
